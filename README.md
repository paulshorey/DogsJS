# Why Dogs ?

- This has been made possible by the awesome API at [dog.ceo](https://dog.ceo)

- This was an experiment - to learn NextJS and test out dynamic routes (and sub-routes).

It works very well. This site renders hundreds of different types of dogs - all nearly instantly (just have to wait for images to load, but the data is pre-loaded using the NextJS framework)

Hosted on Vercel.

## Todo:

This should have unit tests and continuous integration, but it's super simple, and I'm not planning to do anything else with it.

Please feel free to fork it, copy it, use it, make your own dogs directory.
